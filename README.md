# LDTS_T06_G01 - Flappy Bird

## Game Description

In this amazing game you will guide flappy, our little bird, through a world of obstacles. Just like in life, the game gets harder and harder and when you think you've mastered the skill of flying through pipes more and different pipes and potions will appear.
Press Arrow up to slap your wings, dodge the enemies and their different attacks and pay attentions to your life and health.
Some postion will make faster, some will make you slower so be very careful with the potions you drink.
If you want to stop the game at any given point just press esc !
